Thank you for downloading the example scripts and data
for the book Expert T-SQL Window Functions in SQL Server.

The catalog URL for the book on the Apress website is
the following:

http://www.apress.com/9781484211045

You have two choices for generating example data to use
in trying out the solutions in the book:

1) Restore the SQL Server backup from StockAnalysis.bak. 
Doing this will give you the precise same database as
was used to generate the example output in the book.

2) Execute the T-SQL script in the file named
"Code for Stock Analysis.sql". Doing this will give 
data similar to that used in the book, but it will
be randomly-generated. It will be similar in structure,
but not in content.

Option 2 is provided to help those readers who are
unable to restore from a .bak file. And some readers
may simply find it more convenient to execute a script
than to restore a backup.

Examples from the book are in the files and one ZIP archive
that are named as Chapter 1, Chapter 2, and so forth. 

Thank you for your interest in the book. We hope that you
enjoy it and benefit from it. We are honored to have 
published it.

Sincerely,

Apress
